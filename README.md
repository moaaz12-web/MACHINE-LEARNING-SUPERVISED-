# MACHINE-LEARNING-SUPERVISED-
Mathematical pthonic implementation of supervised learning algorithms like linear regression, logistic regression etc from the stanford unviersity MACHINE LEARNING COURSE b Andrew Ng.
There isn't any implementation done via the python libraries (like scikit learn, tenserflow, or keras). All coding is purely mathematical.
