# SUPERVISED-MACHINE-LEARNING-ALGORITHMS-
Mathematical pthonic implementation of supervised learning algorithms like linear regression, logistic regression etc from the stanford university's MACHINE LEARNING COURSE by Andrew Ng.
There isn't any implementation done via the python libraries (like scikit learn, tenserflow, or keras). All coding is purely mathematical.
